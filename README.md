## 💡 The Problem

The average American spends **$273/month** on subscriptions — and most don't even know half of them exist. Forgotten trials, duplicated services, and overpriced plans quietly drain bank accounts every month. Existing tools are generic and offer no personalized guidance.

---

## ✅ Our Solution

SubSave is a full-stack AI web app that:

1. **Onboards users intelligently** — Collects name, age, occupation (student, veteran, healthcare, etc.) and interests to power hyper-personalized recommendations.
2. **Scans & detects subscriptions** — Simulates bank transaction analysis to identify all recurring charges in seconds.
3. **Applies AI-powered analysis** — Uses **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash** to give a punchy, personalized one-liner recommendation for each subscription.
4. **Surfaces cheaper alternatives** — A Tinder-style swipe deck lets users browse AI-curated alternatives with real savings amounts.
5. **Shows real-time savings** — An analytics dashboard with dual charts tracks monthly savings vs. spend over time.
6. **Floating AI chat** — Ask SubSave AI anything about your subscriptions in natural language.
